# Experiment Assignment 5 - Redis

### Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Redis and how you resolved

I installed Redis with docker, which where quite straightforward as I had no issues regarding this. The use of Redis through Jedis was also quite easy as the documentation where quite good: https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/jedis/, all was implemented in simple main method of DemoApplication.java.

### Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

No pending issues, but can implement a more complex solution as all code currently runs in main method of DemoApplication.java.
